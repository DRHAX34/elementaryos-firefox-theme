## Issues
There are issues with this theme: 
1. If you use the bookmark bar, the window controls will go down as well.
2. The new tab button (+) is gone in full screen size mode. (This is not the case in Firefox Nightly).

## Credits
Credits to [Harvey Cabaguio](https://github.com/harveycabaguio/firefox-elementary-theme) and the elementary team for the UI design and icons.

## Install
1. Go to [about:support](about:support) in Firefox
