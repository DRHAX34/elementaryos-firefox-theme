![Screenshot](screenshot_4.png)

## Issues
There are issues with this theme: 
1. If you use the bookmark bar, the window controls will go down as well.
2. The new tab button is gone in full screen size mode. (This is not the case in Firefox Nightly build).
3. The new tab button is not moveable in customization panel. Make sure you move the new tab button to the left without this theme on. After that, you can install this theme.

## Credits
